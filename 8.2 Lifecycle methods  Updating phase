At updating phase of a component, below methods are executed based on props or state being received and updates happens in a component:
    static getDerivedStateFromProps()
    shouldComponentUpdate()
    render()
    getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
    componentDidUpdate()

 

shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState):

Executed before rendering when new state or props are being received

By default it will return true by calling componentDidUpdate() method. If it returns false componentDidUpdate() method will not be invoked

In case we want to skip re-rendering, this method could be used by returning false, so this would skip re-rendering

This method only exists as a performance optimization

 

getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState):

Invoked right before changes are made to the DOM

It is recommended to return a value from this method which will be passed as a third parameter(as 'snapshot') to the componentDidUpdate()

Once the updates flushed to the DOM, immediately next lifecycle method will be invoked


componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot):

Invoked immediately after the changes are updated
