React by default does not provide any helper method to manage Ajax requests
Any other third party JavaScript library can be used to handle Ajax requests
API calls should be made after the component mounts using useEffect hook​​​​​​​
Once the data is fetched, make it available to your component by setting the state of the component to trigger re-render using useState hook








npm install axios




Axios offers the following methods:

axios.get()
axios.post()
axios.put()
axios.delete()
axios.patch()
axios.options()

Get request syntax

axios.get('url')
        .then(result => 
           console.log(result.data)
        )
        .catch(error => 
            console.log(error)
        );

Post request syntax

axios.post('url', { data }).
    then(result =>
        console.log(result.data)
    )
    .catch(error =>
        console.log(error)
    );

You can also use fetch for making API calls, but axios offers some advantages over fetch

1. The response returned by axios is the response that you need, but with fetch you need to use .json method to get the actual response

3. Axios are supported by most of the browsers including Internet Explorer 8+

4. Axios has better error handling

For example, if you try to make the request to a non-existent JSON file employees1.json file 

Axios returns
