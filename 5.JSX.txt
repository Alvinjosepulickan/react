JSX

JSX is a JavaScript syntax extension.
It is a replacement for writing pure JavaScript code
Functional components return JSX elements 
Multiple JSX elements must be wrapped within a container element using React.Fragment or empty tags
JavaScript expressions which need to be evaluated must be wrapped within curly braces
                       
Conditional Rendering

JSX elements can be rendered based on condition using if-else or ternary operator
List of elements can be rendered using map method












JSX has been introduced in React to create elements that are very easy to read and write, which makes the component's code simple and understandable

JSX is a special syntax introduced in ReactJS to write elements of components. 
It is syntactically identical to HTML and hence it can be easily read and written. 
Code written using JSX helps in visualizing the DOM structure easily.
As the browser does not understand JSX code, this gets converted to JavaScript using the plugins of the babel.



As per the JSX syntax, all the adjacent elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag 
    i.e. there should be only one outermost element

By adhering to JSX syntax the <div> tag can be used for grouping the elements and this introduces an extra and unnecessary node into the DOM. 
As a solution to this, React Fragments are introduced which is a common pattern in React for a component to return multiple elements. 
React Fragments allows to group a list of React elements without adding any extra node to the DOM.


You can use empty tags instead of React.Fragment



                        <div>
                        </div>

                        <React.Fragment>
                        </React.Fragment>


                        <>
                        </>



JavaScript expressions to be evaluated should be wrapped within curly braces as follows:
        <h1> { Expression to be evaluated } </h1>
Content which has to be displayed as is will be written in double quotes, wrapped within curly braces as follows:
        <h1> {" Content to be displayed "} </h1>
