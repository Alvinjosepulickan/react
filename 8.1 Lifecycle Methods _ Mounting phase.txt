At mounting phase of a component, following methods which will be invoked:
    constructor()
    static getDerivedStateFromProps()
    render()
    componentDidMount()

 

constructor(): Constructors are used only for the below 2 purposes which we have already seen in the state demo:
    Initializing state of a component
    For binding event handler methods to an instance

 

static getDerivedStateFromProps(): getDerivedStateFromProps() is invoked right before the render method. This method is called both in mounting and updating phase. 

 

render(): Every React component must have render() method. render() method should be a pure function which returns the same result every time it is called which means, it doesn't modify any component's state.

 

componentDidMount():
    Invoked immediately after the component is mounted to DOM tree
    Now will have access to all the DOM nodes hence any initialization which requires DOM nodes should be done here
    Best place for setting timers and handling Ajax request
