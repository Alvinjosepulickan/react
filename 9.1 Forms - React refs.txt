In React, ref provides a way to access the DOM node or the React elements, and helps in getting the value from the DOM.
refs are to be used when we have the below requirements:
    1. Integrating with third-party libraries, like D3 which has it's own DOM manipulation API's
    2. To use media playbacks like audio, video. refs provide control over the DOM API.
    3. Trigger imperative animations
By using refs, we are deviating from the React way of handling data. In React we store data as state and when the state in updated component gets re-rendered. This follows a unidirectional data flow and the data is stored in a single source of truth i.e., state.

You can create two types of forms in React:
    1. Controlled component
    2. Uncontrolled component

Controlled component: In controlled components the input values are set to corresponding state variables and when the value changes, the state is updated accordingly.
Uncontrolled component:  In an uncontrolled component, the form elements data is handled by the DOM and not by the state. 




To create refs you can use useRef hook 
let countRef = useRef(0)  
input type="text" ref={countRef} />
