There are 2 types of components that can be created in React
    1. Class based components
    2. Functional components

Functional Components
•    Created as a simple JavaScript function
•    It just returns the HTML elements






The functional component can be created as follows:

                                import React from 'react';
                                function App() {
                                    return React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hello World!!!");
                                }
                                export default App;





App - The component name should be in Pascal Casing
React.createElement - helps to create an element in plain JavaScript





In the code, React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hello World!!!");

        h1 - is the HTML element to be used
        { } - Attributes of an element can be mentioned
        "Hello World!!!" - Content to be appended to the h1 element
        export default App - App component must be exported so that it could be used in any other files
        To display elements of a component, the component must be rendered.
        For rendering a component, ReactDOM.render method is used as follows:
        Syntax:

                ReactDOM.render(<parameter 1/>, parameter 2); 




index.js:
    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
    import './index.css';
    import App from './App';
    ReactDOM.render(<App/>, document.getElementById('root'));
    reportWebVitals();
