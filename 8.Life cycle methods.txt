Every component will have following phases in its Lifecycle:
    Mounting phase - when the component is mounted to DOM tree
    Updating phase - when component is being updated with new state, new props are being received
    Unmounting phase - destroying component from DOM tree
    Error Handling - Handling errors within React Component

 

Every phase in the lifecycle of a component has few methods which will be invoked during that phase of a component's lifecycle. We can override these methods to provide the desired functionality.
These methods can be used in the following cases:
    For making an Ajax call, to set timer and to integrate with other frameworks
    To avoid unnecessary re-rendering of a component
    To update the component, based on the props changes
    For clearing the values when component is unmounted
