What is React
1. React JS is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces
2. ReactJS Optimizes the DOM manipulation by writing very simple code
3. React is used for applications where the data keeps changing very frequently

Features​​​​​​​
1. Component based architecture
2. Virtual DOM
3.Unidirectional data flow
4. JSX 
5. SEO performance


The key features of React are:
    Component-based architecture: 
        A Component is the smallest unit in a React application. 
        Anything that you want to render on the browser can be rendered through components. 
        Components help in maintainability and re-usability.
    Virtual DOM: 
        React uses virtual DOM concept for DOM manipulation which improves the performance of the application
    Unidirectional data flow:  
        React’s one-way data flow (also called one-way binding) keeps everything modular and fast and easy for debugging.
    JSX syntax: 
        React used JSX syntax which is similar to XML and HTML syntax which makes it easy for writing markup and binding events in components 
    SEO performance: 
        The SEO performance can be improved using the server-side rendering concept. 
        We can develop isomorphic applications using React which increases the SEO performance.
