Lifecycle methods are needed in the following cases:
•    For making an Ajax call, to set timer and to integrate with other frameworks
•    To avoid unnecessary re-rendering of a component
•    To update the component, based on the props changes
•    For clearing the values when component is unmounted
 

Every component will have following phases in its Lifecycle:
    Mounting phase - when the component is mounted to DOM tree
    Updating phase - when component is being updated with new state, new  props are being received
    Unmounting phase - destroying component from DOM tree ​​​​​​​
