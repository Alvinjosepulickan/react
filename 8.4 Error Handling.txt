Error handling can be taken care in React using the below methods
    static getDerivedStateFromError()  
    componentDidCatch()
    Error boundaries should be defined in order to catch errors occurring within the child components. Whenever a component crashes because of a JavaScript error, the error will be logged and fall back UI is displayed.
    Error boundaries are nothing but class components which defines either getDerivedStateFromError or componentDidCatch method
