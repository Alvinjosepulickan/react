When we want to pass any data from one component to another component, it is passed as a prop.

Props allow us to pass data from one component to another component

Props are immutable - a component cannot change its props however it is responsible for putting together

Props can be accessed as this.props




How to use props?

Let's now learn how to pass data to a component:

    <App initial = {10} />

Here, we are passing a property 'initial' with a value '10', to a component App.

In the component App, this property would be accessed as this.props.initial
