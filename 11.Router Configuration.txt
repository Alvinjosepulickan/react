npm install react-router-dom


import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Link} from 'react-router-dom';





<BrowserRouter>: It is a primary component containing the entire routing configuration. 
    It is a more popular one because it uses the HTML5 History API to keep track of your router history. 
    All the routes should be wrapped within a container element such as div.

<Route>: It is a prop of Router. 
    It maps routes to our application’s component hierarchy using "path“ and "component" props and sets all navigational routes

path: Maps to the path given in URL

component: Contains component name to be rendered when the route is mapped

exact: This property tells Route to match the exact path. In the below example Header component will render when the browser's location path matches exactly /









<Router> 
  <!--Configures route for main component i.e. Header-->
	<div>
 	        <Route exact path = "/" component = {Header} />             
	        <Route path = "/login" component = {Login} />  <!--Configures route for Login component--> 
	        <Route path = "/home" component = {Home} />    <!--Configures route for Home component-->
	</div> 
</Router> 



<Link to="/home"> Home </Link>
<Link to="/login"> Login </Link>
