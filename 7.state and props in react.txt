In a real-time application, components must deal with dynamic data.
This data could be something internal to the component or may be the data that is passed from another component. 
To bind the data to the component, you need two JS objects i.e. state and props.


What is State?

The state is an initial value set for a component, which is used for interactivity.
Using constructor, the state of a component is created and initialized using this.state as follows:

constructor() {
     super();
	 this.state = { counter: 1 };
}


this.state.counter.

As the user-defined component extends React.Component, 
it becomes a child component of it. 
Hence, whenever a child component has a constructor, it has to call the parent class's constructor using the super() method. 
And super() method should be the first statement within a constructor.
